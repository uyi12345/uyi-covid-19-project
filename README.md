# uyi-covid-19-project# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations. The notebook utilizes Python data tools to clean, process, and visualize data from the "Our World in Data" COVID-19 dataset.

---

## **Objectives**

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
- Compare metrics across countries/regions.
- Visualize trends with charts and maps.
- Communicate findings in a report.

---

## **File Details**

- `uyi covid 19 project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
- `owid-covid-data.csv`: Dataset from the "Our World in Data" source.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Install Required Libraries**

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`
- `geopandas`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly geopandas
```

### 2. **File Structure**

Place the following files in the same directory:

- `uyi covid 19 project.ipynb`
- `owid-covid-data.csv`

### 3. **Run the Notebook**

1. Open the notebook (`uyi covid project.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to explore the analysis and visualizations.

## **Steps in the Analysis**

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Downloaded the dataset from "Our World in Data."

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Filtered columns of interest.
   - Handled missing values via interpolation.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
   - Compared metrics across selected countries.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created line plots, bar charts, and choropleth maps.

5. **Key Insights**:
   - Noted trends and vaccination progress across countries.
   - Highlighted countries with the highest number of cases.

- Noted trends and vaccination progress across countries.
  - Highlighted countries with the highest number of cases.

## **Visualizations**

The project includes:

- Line charts for trends over time (e.g., total cases, vaccinations).
- Bar plots for top 10 countries by total cases.
- Choropleth map showing global case density.

---

## **Key Insights**

- The United States has the highest number of total cases as of the latest date.
- Vaccination progress varies significantly across countries.
- Seasonal trends are visible in daily new cases and deaths for some countries.

---

## **Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 trends. The findings and visualizations help identify critical patterns and support informed decision-making.
